# Cleft-Palate-Speech-Outcomes-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis

The code and results from my analysis of cleft palate speech outcomes

These are the files from my final project for my longitudinal analysis class. I analyzed the relationship between cleft palate/non-cleft palate status and consonant
production outcomes over time for young children using linear mixed effects models in R. See the Powerpoint for the project summary.

Many thanks to Dr. Kathy Chapman at the University of Utah for providing me with the dataset.
