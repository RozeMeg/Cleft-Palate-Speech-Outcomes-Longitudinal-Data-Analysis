# Cleft-Palate-Speech-Outcomes-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis

The code from my analysis of cleft palate speech outcomes

This is the code file from my final project for my longitudinal analysis class. I analyzed the relationship between cleft palate/non-cleft palate status and consonant
production outcomes over time for young children using linear mixed effects models in R. Many thanks to Dr. Kathy Chapman at the University of Utah for providing me with the dataset.

For the sake of being careful about where I present other people's experimental results, I'm not including the summary presentation or paper here. However, if you have any questions, I'm happy to talk with you about the process and findings.
